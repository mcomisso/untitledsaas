# Forj Intel Landing Page Redesign Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the current coaching-only landing page into a unified platform that sells **BOTH** the YouTube analytics SaaS product AND human coaching as complementary offerings. The goal is to position Forj Intel as a complete creator growth ecosystem where the tool provides data and the coaching provides direction.

---

## Strategic Positioning

### The Core Narrative
> "The smartest creators don't just work harder—they work with **intelligence** AND **guidance**."

**Position the hybrid offering as:**
1. **The Tool** → Your 24/7 data analyst (always watching, always learning)
2. **The Coach** → Your strategic partner (human expertise when you need direction)

**Key differentiator:** Unlike pure SaaS tools (vidIQ, TubeBuddy) that give you data without direction, or pure coaching that lacks ongoing metrics, Forj Intel gives you BOTH—the dashboard to see what's happening and the expert to tell you what to do about it.

## Competitor Analysis & Inspiration

### SaaS-Only Competitors
| Tool | Strength | Weakness |
|------|----------|----------|
| vidIQ | Deep analytics, trend tools | No human support, overwhelming UX |
| TubeBuddy | SEO optimization, bulk tools | Feature bloat, no strategy guidance |
| Morning Fame | Clean UX, focused metrics | Limited features, no coaching |

### Coaching-Only Competitors
| Service | Strength | Weakness |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Creator coaching services | Personalized strategy | No ongoing data tracking |
| YouTube consultants | Expert advice | Expensive, one-time |

### Hybrid Inspirations
| Platform | What They Do Right |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Kajabi** | Sells software + coaching as premium tier |
| **Teachable** | Tool + education bundled |
| **HubSpot** | Free tool hooks → paid services upsell |
| **Shopify** | Platform + "Shopify Experts" directory |

**Key learning:** The most successful hybrid models lead with the **tool** (lower barrier to entry) and upsell to **services** (higher LTV).

→ "Views, CTR, retention—but what should you actually DO differently?"

Pain 3: "You tried tools but ended up more confused"
→ "More data ≠ more clarity. You need insights, not just numbers."

Pain 4: "You can't afford a full-time strategist"
→ "Agency retainers start at $2K/month. You need affordable expertise."
```

📉 Inconsistent growth → Guessing at strategy

↓ [Arrow with "With Forj Intel" label]

After (Where you could be):
🎯 Consistent 50+ engaged viewers → Predictable, data-driven growth
📊 Clear content strategy that works → AI + coach-backed decisions
💰 Sustainable income stream → Monetization roadmap
📈 Predictable month-over-month growth → Compound growth trajectory

### Section 10: FAQ

**Purpose:** Handle objections and reduce friction

**Questions to answer:**

```
Q: Do I need the paid plan to get coaching?
A: No! Coaching is available to all users. Free users can book strategy
   sessions at our standard rate. Pro/Growth members get discounted rates.

A: Absolutely. Our free tier is perfect for new creators. And early-stage
   is actually the BEST time for a strategy call—before you build bad habits.

Q: What platforms do you support?
A: Currently YouTube-focused. Twitch, TikTok, and other platform
   analytics coming soon.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Yes. No contracts, no commitments. Cancel with one click.

Q: How quickly do I see results?
A: The dashboard gives insights immediately upon connecting.
   Growth results vary, but most users report noticeable improvements
   within 30-60 days of consistent use.
